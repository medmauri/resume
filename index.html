        <h3>Senior Manager - IBM de México</h3>
      </li>
      <p>Feb 2021 - present</p>
      <p>
        I currently help align my employees' activities and focus to IBM's
        global strategy. I collaborate with other leaders to allocate resources,
        so we meet company and individual needs. I accept accountability for
        business results in several measurements. I foster teamwork and
        inclusion and promote IBM's values while providing my employees feedback
        to improve performance. I establish clear performance expectations and
        hold people accountable for results; I also recognize contributions by
        employees and teams. I lead by example and support change, encourage
        employees to innovate, state suggestions, and remove obstacles to
        implementation.

      <li>
        <h3>Iteration Manager - IBM de México</h3>
      </li>
      <p>Nov 2018 - Feb 2021</p>
      <p>
        I ensured that my IBM Corporate clients' needs were satisfied through
        the formulation, development, implementation and delivery of application
        solutions in response to their requirements expressed in approved user
        stories. I was responsible for the overall project plan, budget,
        structure, schedule and staffing requirements for the Corporate
        Functions organization. Incumbents were required to manage efforts of
        IBM and client employees as well as third-party vendors to ensure that
        an integrated solution was provided to meet the client needs while
        focusing on individual, team, and department operational objectives.

        <h3>Project Manager - IBM de México</h3>
      </li>
      <p>Apr 2016 - Nov 2018</p>
      <p>
        I was responsible for leading developer teams in delivering solutions to
        IBM's Technical Support Services unit by the means of using the
        appropriate business measurements and terms and conditions for the
        project according to the project agreement or contract. I had overall
        performance responsibility for managing scope, cost, schedule, and
        contractual deliverables, which includes applying techniques for
        planning, tracking, change control, and risk management. I was
        responsible for managing our development project resources, and for
        establishing an effective communication plan between our DEV team and
        the TSS unit. I provide direction to the project team and regular
        project status to our end users.

        <h3>Operations Management Team Lead - IBM de México</h3>
      </li>
      <p>Jan 2013 - Apr 2016</p>
      <p>
        I applied my expertise in IT resources management for technical support
        applications and the end to end business process that those applications
        supported. I was proactive in the management of assets availability to
        support the business needs and to lead cross functional teams in the
        resolution of any system problems together with the follow on root cause
        analysis and implementation of preventative actions. Typical examples of
        the deliverables were month and quarter end availability planning,
        leading the resolution of severity 1 problems and critical situations,
        scheduling and management of changes, optimizing the running cost of
        applications sets and providing the related yearly financial planning
        input.

      </li>
      <p>Nov 2007 - Dec 2012</p>
      <p>
        I used my developer knowledge creating diverse front-end solutions for
        different customers' websites. I primarily utilized the ActionScript 2.0
        language although I also tended to use the ActionScript 3.0 language.
        Some of the projects I worked on were used as stand-alone applications
        within Shockwave Flash containers, while others were used a banners or
        other forms of publicity or advertising for small businesses.
